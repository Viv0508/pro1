0,"At this initial phase, the plant displays only the cotyledon with no true leaves present, marking the very start of its growth."
1,"During early development, the plant produces its first true leaf alongside the cotyledon, signaling the onset of vegetative growth."
2,"At this stage, two true leaves have emerged in addition to the cotyledon, indicating further progression from the germination phase."
3,"Here, the plant exhibits three true leaves together with the cotyledon, demonstrating continued early growth and enhanced potential for photosynthesis."
4,"At this point, four true leaves accompany the cotyledon, reflecting a steady advancement in the plantâ€™s developmental process."
5,"In this phase, the emergence of five true leaves alongside the cotyledon represents a notable step in overall growth."
6,"The plant now shows six true leaves in addition to the cotyledon, marking solid progress in its vegetative development."
7,"At this level, the plant forms seven true leaves along with the cotyledon, suggesting it is approaching a more mature stage of development."
8,"In a more advanced phase, the plant has developed eight or more true leaves in addition to the cotyledon, indicating it is well beyond its earliest stages and entering a mature growth period."
